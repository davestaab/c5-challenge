# Challenge: Easter Bunny
 
The Easter Bunny has approached Cadre5 with a deceptively simple request, she wants to make sure that all of the Easter baskets this year are as good as they possibly can be. Through years of rigorous research, she holds infallible rankings for the value that children place on sweets and treats. However, the kids can only get one basket. 

## The Goal
Given the value the Easter bunny has determined the sweets to be worth, a weight for a treat, and a maximum weight for a basket, find the basket with the highest possible value. 

## The Requirements
A console application will take a file path as a command line argument. The file format will be as follows:
* The first line will be a header consisting of a single 32-bit signed integer
* The signed integer is the maximum weight that a basket can hold
* Two tab separated columns representing the weights and values of treats
* Each line will consist of first a weight and second a value
* The weight and the value will both be an 32-bit signed integer
* The program will output a list of tab separated tuples representing the best possible basket
* The output will be sorted in ascending order of treat weight
* The program will output to stdout

If you would still like to participate, you have until the ***end of day Friday (4/12)*** to join. The program will be due by 12:00 PM on April 22nd.

For this challenge, fastest will be determined by execution time only. James Matta has set up a machine that can be used to test out your code. The machine is not a power house, so please do not use it for active development. However, to be a valid program it must build and run on this machine.
